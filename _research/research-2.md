This project develops an unobtrusive silent speech recognition system using skin-conformable, self-adhesive, semi-transparent dry electrodes to capture high-fidelity electromyogram signals. Machine learning algorithms decode these signals into spoken words, ensuring robust performance in noisy and dark environments. The system supports real-time analysis through cloud services and MQTT methods. Its applications in augmented reality and medical services highlight its potential to enhance immersive interaction and healthcare.
