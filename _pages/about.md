I am a researcher specializing in soft wearable devices. My research aims to advance the development of soft electronics through innovative approaches of smart materials, smart structures, advanced manufacturing technologies, and machine learning methods. I am particularly interested in exploring their potential applications in healthcare, activity tracking, and human-machine interactions.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), under the supervision of Dr. [Shanshan Yao](https://me.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/Yao_Shanshan.php). I earned my master's and bachelor's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) and [China University of Mining and Technology](https://global.cumt.edu.cn/), respectively. [My academic work](https://penghao-dong.github.io/publications/) has been published or is forthcoming in *Small*, *Materials Horizons*, *Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence*, and *Advanced Materials Technologies*, among other outlets. The primary focus of these publications is on applying stretchable EMG electrodes and soft magnetic skin to [silent speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_speech_interface) tasks.

What's new?
======
- 05/2024: I successfully defended my PhD dissertation proposal titled 'Unobtrusive Silent Speech Interfaces Enabled by Soft Electronics'!
- 11/2023: <a href="/files/poster1.pdf">Poster</a> presentation at 2023 MRS Fall Meeting & Exhibit in Boston.
- 09/2023: Our [paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/mh/d3mh01062g) on magnetic skin has been published on *Materials Horizons*!
- 01/2023: Our [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.202205058) on ultrathin dry electrode has been published on *Small*!
- 01/2022: I successfully passed the PhD quality exam!

<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->

<!-- A data-driven personal website
====== -->
<!-- Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->
